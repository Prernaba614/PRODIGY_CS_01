# PRODIGY_CS_01
User Input: The program allows users to input a message and specify a shift value (an integer between 0 and 25) for both encryption and decryption processes.

Encryption Functionality: Users can encrypt plain text messages, transforming them into encoded text that can be securely transmitted or stored.

Decryption Functionality: The program can also reverse the encryption process, allowing users to retrieve the original message using the same shift value.

Robust Handling: The program handles both uppercase and lowercase letters while leaving non-alphabetic characters (such as spaces and punctuation) unchanged.

User Interaction:
The program features a simple command-line interface that guides users through the encryption and decryption processes. Users can choose to encrypt or decrypt a message or exit the program, making it user-friendly and accessible.
